# Seeds-ML
Expanded from my Super Simple ML. Basically seeing if the randomish weights can be used for more sophisticated problems. It's been awhile since I've worked on this and it is very much unfinished, but I intend to get back to it one day. 

The ultimate goal is to create a machine learing package that a non-programmer can use. At first it will be a command line utility that will prompt the user for inputs that will direct what happens. IE. Would you like to Train, Test or Predict? It will also ask for path to datasets and split them automatically into training and testing sets.

One day, once it's working, I will implement a GUI for even easier usage.

For now, as stated, I'm still hoping the Super-Simple_ML algorithm will work for this, but I have some doubts. If it doesnt, I'll end up using Tensor or SciKitLearn. The main thing here is getting a user friendly Machine Learning software package up and working that is so easy and intuitive that your grandma can use it.
